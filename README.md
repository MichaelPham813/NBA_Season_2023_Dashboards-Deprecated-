# NBA_Season_2023_Dashboards (Deprecated)

#Important
The dashboards are deprecated since the free access I got included stats and season average but they have changed their policy, which had deprecated the project.

## Introduction
This is an assignment that I have done during the Business Analytics course at Cambrian College. The dashboard is a basic dashboard that shows you the stats of 2 players and the whole season game.

## Difiiculty
Since the API has free users and subscription users, I have a limited version of the API but it is sufficient enough for me to make a dashboard for it. Another thing is that I could have used Plotly for the whole dashboard website instead of Flask, but the class have tight due dates so I have to use Flask to speed it up.

## Solution
If I had finished the dashboard again, I would have used Plotly for the dashboard for better visuals and interaction. The second thing I would have changed would be reorganizing the dashboard's design for a better look and easy to visualize.

## Conclusion
The basic dashboards about NBA players I did in the Business Analytics course at Cambrian College. We need to fix the interaction and visuals for future viewers and users.
